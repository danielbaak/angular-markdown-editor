A while back I wrote a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor with
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) as part of a workshop I was doing at
[The Armory Workspace](http://www.thearmoryworkspace.com/):
[backbone-markdown-editor](https://github.com/whitlockjc/backbone-markdown-editor).  This project is that same
application but written using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

### Using
To run this application, after cloning run the following in the root of the cloned repository:

```
$ npm install
// This will install the application dependencies
$ npm start
// This will start the Express server listening on port 3000
```

After the server is running, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
